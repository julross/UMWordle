For a class in the University of Michigan's School of Information, I took on the challenge of recreating Wordle using Python and the Pygame library in the fall of 2022. Building the game was both challenging and rewarding, as it pushed me to think critically about logic, user interaction, and graphical design. The result is an interactive game with colorful feedback for guesses, all coded in Visual Studio Code. It was a great way to bring creativity and problem-solving together!
